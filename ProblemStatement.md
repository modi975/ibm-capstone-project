## Introduction

Covid-19 has brought whole world to a standstill which has never been witnessed in last 100 years. With countries worldwide enforcing lockdown, people had to adjust to this new normal of social distancing. Society and Economy thrives on people being social and we are just realizing its importance right now. Last few months have been hard on everyone but, things are looking to improve. A vaccination seems to be coming in near future. 

With this ray of hope countries and economies are starting to open up. Through this analysis, I wish to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the worlds largest economy, the USA. USA has reported over 2 million COVID-19 cases positive and has the largest death toll in the world. USA government has projected over 150k deaths and they say if they are able to limit the death toll to this number, it will be win for them.
In this analysis, we will see trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths at different levels, first as a whole country, then we dive into states and then we deep dive in to different counties (districts. We will also try to find out reason why USA is most effected.

Finally, we will recommend safe outdoor activities using FourSquare APIs that we can indulge ourselves in and try to get back to our normal lives, like in pre-covid times.
